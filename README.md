## How Did You Make the App?

The app was made using with Node.js and the following NPM packages:

* [mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - A NPM package for accessing MySQL databases with Node 
   
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - A NPM package to create command line interfaces. For this application, the package is used to ask the user questions and collection information.

* [Currency Formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/currency-formatter) - A NPM package to format numbers as currency. 

## What's Next

Currently there is only one function that runs the entire program. I would like to create multiple functions that break up the different events for improved readability.
